# Documents

## Add a new document

Create documents by clicking the New Document button in the document drawer menu. This will create and add a new document to the list underneath the button. The documents in the list are sorted by the last time each was modified.

## Saving

Documents and linked content is saved as you make edits or changes. If you don't want this functionality, the _autosave_ setting can be disabled in your settings.

To save documents, use `cmd+S` ( or `control+S` ) for the active document. A small dark circle indicator will persist if there are unsaved changes in a document.

## Editing

### document titles

Once a document is selected, click on the bold title to edit. By default, the initial title is generated form the content of the document. Changing the title does not change the content of the document. The document will be titled untitled doc if no title is chosen or can be generated from the content.

### documents

To edit documents, type and add different styles or content blocks from the menu bar. If a document is locked, it can not be edited until it's unlocked. If a document is published, then all changes in the document will be _immediately_ available in the published version.

All content associated with the document (to-do items, code snippets, etc.) is also removed if the document is deleted.

## Duplicate

A document can be duplicated by clicking the duplicate document icon located in the top right of each document. This action will create a new document with the same content as the original.

When duplicating, all to-do items are reset. This means that any selected due dates and completed to-do items will be reset

## Document settings

### Lock a document from editing

Documents can be locked in each document's settings. It's recommended that you lock documents that are published if you want to avoid any accidental actions. Documents can be locked and unlocked as often as you like. For that reason, we think it's a good practice to lock documents that you don't want to change.

### Publishing a document

A published document (or slides) are public to the entire internet. Once published, the published link can be shared. The changes that you make to the document are immediately reflected in the public version. To publish, click the publish button in the document settings.

### Specifying a code theme

You can pick a specific code highlighting theme for each document. By default, the theme that you have set in your user settings will be used. Just pick a new theme in the document-specific settings. This can be changed as often as you'd like.

### Deleting a document

A document can be deleted by clicking the delete option in the document's settings menu. The document can only be deleted when it's not locked. The document is not available after it's deleted - it's immediately removed.

If a document is published, the public URL and content will no longer be available if the document is deleted.
