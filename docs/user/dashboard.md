# Dashboard

Your dashboard is an overview of all of your documents. Each document listing will show whether or not the document is shown on your [profile](/user/profile.html) (if enabled) or not.

You can navigate directly to the each document, or the document's specific settings, by using the `Go to document` and `Settings` links.
