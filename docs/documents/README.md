## Add a new document

Create documents by clicking the New Document button in the document drawer menu. This will create and add a new document to the list underneath the button. The documents in the list are sorted by the last time each was modified.

## Saving

Documents and the associated content is saved as you make edits or changes. If you don't want this functionality, the autosave setting can be disabled in your settings.

Documents can be manually saved by using cmd+S ( or control+S ) for the active document. A small dark circle indicator will persist if there have been changes to a document that have not been saved.

## Editing

### document titles

Once a document is selected, click on the bold title to edit. By default, the initial title is generated form the content of the document. Changing the title does not change the content of the document. The document will be titled untitled doc if no title is chosen or can be generated from the content.

### documents

Documents can be edited by typing and adding different styles or content blocks from the menu bar. If a document is locked, then it can not be edited until it is unlocked. If a document is published, then all changes in the document will be immediately available in the published version.

All content associated with the document (to-do items, code snippets, etc.) is also removed if the document is deleted.

## Duplicate

A document can be duplicated by clicking the duplicate document icon located in the top right of each document. This action will create a new document with the same content as the original.

When duplicating, all to-do items are reset. This means that any selected due dates and completed to-do items will be reset

## Deleting a document

A document can be deleted by manually clicking the delete option in the document's settings menu. The document can only be deleted when it is not locked. The document is not available after it is deleted - it is immediately removed.

If a document is published, the public URL and content will no longer be available if the document is deleted.

## Lock a document from editing

Documents can be locked in each document's settings. It's recommended that you lock documents that are published if you want to avoid any accidental actions. Documents can be locked and unlocked as often as you like. For that reason, we think it's a good practice to lock documents that you don't want to change.
