# Creating slide presentations

A document becomes a slide presentation when one or more slide content items are in the document. When published, only the content contained in the slide blocks is part of the presentation.

## Adding slides

Place a slide into a document using the editor bar menu. After that, any content placed within that slide section will become a presentation slide when the document is published.

## Viewing presentation

Once the document is [published as slides](/publishing/slideshows.html), open the public link to view. The slides will now be part of an HTML presentation running in the browser.
