# Creating topic tags

A topic tag can be inserted into a document by typing `#` directly followed by a topic label. Topics are used as quick identifiers for grouping content and also can be filtered by selecting a given topic in the document drawer.

Once created in a document, a topic can be added to any other document. Multiple topics can be added to a single document. A topic is removed if it not linked to any document. It can always be created again by adding it back into a document.

## Deleting a topic from a document

A topic can be removed from a document by deleting it from the content.

## Deleting topics

A topic is only removed if it's not referenced in any document.
