# Quick start topics

Welcome to the lowercase documentation site! The below topics are meant to get you up-and-running fast with lowercase.

## Creating and editing documents

The best way to get started with lowercase quickly is to start creating and editing documents.

- [Adding new documents](/guide/documents.html#add-a-new-document)
- [Edit the document title](/guide/documents.html#document-titles)
- [View the document's settings](/guide/documents.html#document-settings)
- [Lock a document](/guide/documents.html#lock-a-document-from-editing) so that it can't be edited.

## Creating to-dos within your documents

To-dos are a great way to keep track of thoughts, ideas, and deadlines across one or more documents. Also, you can share your to-do progress by publishing a document that contains to-do items.

- [Create and edit to-dos](/guide/to-dos.html#weekly-update-emails)
- [Receive a weekly email](/user/settings.html#weekly-to-do-update-emails) listing out your to-do progress

## Adding topic tags to content

Topics are an easy way to tag and find content later by filtering and searching.

- [Using topic tags](/guide/topic-tags.html#creating-topic-tags)

## Configuring your lowercase user settings

We set you up with a few default settings but not everyone likes the same setup.

- [Adjust your user settings](/user/settings.html#make-profile-public)

## Locking vs. Publishing a document

A _locked_ document is one that can't be edited. A _published_ document is one that has a public URL and can be shared.

Sometimes you may want to lock a document that you've published so that you don't accidentally edit it once it's shared.

- [Lock a document](/guide/documents.html#lock-a-document-from-editing) in the document's setting page
- [Publish a document or slide presentation](/guide/documents.html#publishing-a-document)

## Create a public profile page

Is it possible to create a public profile with lowercase?? Yes!

- [Make your profile public](/user/profile.html)
- [Publish a document](/guide/documents.html#publishing-a-document)
- [Make a custom URL for a document](/publishing/documents.html#custom-urls)
- [Add the document to your public profile](/guide/documents.html#add-document-to-public-profile)

## Create a public slide presentation from a document

Slide presentations are a great way to show off your content.

- [Creating slide presentations](/guide/slides.html#adding-slides)

## Embed your published pages into another site

What if you want to embed your slides or document into another site? No problem, you can embed any published content into another site.

- [Embedding presentations in other sites](/guide/slides.html#embedding-presentations-in-other-sites)

## Add syntax highlighting to your code snippets

- [Enable and use syntax highlighting](/guide/code.html#code-syntax-highlighting)
