# Documents

## Add a new document

Create documents by clicking the **New Document** button in the document drawer menu. This will create and add a new document to the list underneath the button. The documents in the list are sorted by the last time each was modified.

## Saving

Documents and linked content is saved as you make edits or changes. If you don't want this functionality, the _autosave_ setting can be disabled in your settings.

To save documents, use `cmd+S` ( or `control+S` ) for the active document. A small dark circle indicator will persist if there are unsaved changes in a document.

## Editing

### Documents

To edit documents, type, and add different styles or content blocks from the menu bar. If a document is locked, it can't be edited until it's unlocked. If a document is published, then all changes in the document will be _immediately_ available in the published version.

All content associated with the document (to-do items, code snippets, etc.) is also removed if the document is deleted.

### Document titles

Once a document is selected, click on the bold title to edit. By default, the initial title is generated form the content of the document. Changing the title doesn't change the content of the document. The document will be titled untitled doc if no title is chosen or can be generated from the content.

## Document settings

Open the document settings by clicking on the _more_ icon in each document.

### Lock a document from editing

Documents can be locked in each document's settings. It's recommended that you lock documents that are published if you want to avoid any accidental actions. Documents can be locked and unlocked as often as you like. For that reason, we think it's a good practice to lock documents that you don't want to change.

### Publishing a document

A published document (or slides) are public to the entire Internet. Once published, the published link can be shared. The changes that you make to the document are immediately reflected in the public version. To publish, click the publish button in the document settings.

More information on [publishing a document](/publishing/documents.html) or [publishing slide presentations](/publishing/slideshows.html).

### Specifying a code theme

::: tip
Code syntax highlighting can be enabled in your [user settings](/user-settings/settings.html#code-theme).
:::

You can pick a specific code highlighting theme for _each document_. By default, the theme that you have set in your user settings will be used. Just pick a new theme in the document-specific settings. This can be changed as often as you'd like.

### Deleting a document

::: danger
If a document is published, the public URL and content will no longer be available if the document is deleted.
:::

A document can be deleted by clicking the delete option in the document's settings menu. The document can only be deleted when it's not locked. The document is not available after it's deleted - **it's immediately removed**.
