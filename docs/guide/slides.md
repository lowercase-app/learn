# Creating slide presentations

A document becomes a slide presentation when one or more slide content items are in the document. When published, only the content contained in the slide blocks is part of the presentation.

## Adding slides

Place a slide into a document using the editor bar menu. After that, any content placed within that slide section will become a presentation slide when the document is published.

## Viewing presentations

Once the document is [published as slides](/publishing/slideshows.html), open the public link to view. The slides will now be part of an HTML presentation running in the browser.

The below example can be tested in full screen <a href="https://www.lowercase.app/@help/p/722f7883-aa7e-408e-9de7-1e61f1b6473b/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<div style="border-style: solid;
    border-width: 1px;
    border-color: #CCCCCC;
    border-radius: .125rem;"
>
  <iframe width="100%" height="420" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="https://www.lowercase.app/@help/p/722f7883-aa7e-408e-9de7-1e61f1b6473b"></iframe>
</div>

## Embedding presentations in other sites

Slide presentations can be embedded into other sites. This is good for creating a collection or portfolio. To get the embed code, click **Show embed code** in the **Public URL** section located in the [document settings](/#document-settings).
