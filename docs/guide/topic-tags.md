# Creating topic tags

Topics are used as quick identifiers for grouping and categorizing content.

A topic tag can be inserted into a document by typing `#` directly followed by a topic label.

Once created in a document, a topic can be added to any other document.

<img src="/select-topic.png" alt="Select topic" style="width: 40%" />

Multiple topics can be added to a single document. A topic [is removed](#deleting-topics) if it not linked to any document. It can always be created again by adding it back into a document.

## Filtering documents by topic

You can filter documents by selecting a topic in the file drawer.

## Deleting a topic from a document

A topic can be removed from a document by deleting it from the content.

## Deleting topics

A topic is only removed from the side drawer section if it's not referenced in any document.
