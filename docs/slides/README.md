## Publishing slide presentations

A document becomes a slide presentation when one or more slide content items are in the document. When published, only the content contained in the slide blocks is part of the presentation.

Access and settings for slide presentations are the same as published documents.

Do not publish content that you want to keep private or content that contains private information that you do not want to share.
