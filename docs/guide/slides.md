# Creating slide presentations

A document becomes a slide presentation when one or more slide content items are in the document. When published, only the content contained in the slide blocks is part of the presentation.

Place a slide into a document using the editor bar menu. After that, any content placed within that slide section will become a presentation slide when the document is published.
