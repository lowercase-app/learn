# Code syntax highlighting

Easily add beautiful code snippets to your notes using a familiar markdown fenced code block. Each block can be language specific and displays in notes and slide presentations.

![Syntax highlighting](/syntax-highlight.png)
<small>Example Python syntax highlighting using Github Gist theme.</small>

If the [code theme](/user-settings/settings.html#code-theme) is enabled in your settings, then each document will use the selected code theme by default when a document is created. The theme can be changed by selected a different theme in the document's settings.

## Themes

When published, all code will be highlighted using the document-specific theme. If not selected, the selected theme in your settings will be used.

Code themes available include _Github_, _GitHub Gist_, _Nord_, _A11y Dark_, _A11y Light_, and _Tomorrow Night_.

## Programming Languages

Invoke a specific syntax highlight by prefixing the name with ` ``` `.

Try to always use a specific command above if applicable to the language
that you are using. There will always be a corresponding language input rule as
new languages are added.

If enabled, the programming languages supported are:

| language   | input command     |

| JavaScript | ` ```javascript ` |
| SQL        | ` ```sql `        |
