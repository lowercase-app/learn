# Publishing slide presentations

::: warning
Don't publish content that you want to keep private or content that contains private information that you don't want to share.
:::

A document becomes a slide presentation when one or more slides are in the document. When published, only the content contained in the slide blocks is part of the presentation.

Access and settings for slide presentations are the same as published documents.

## Custom URLs

The public URL can be changed to a custom identifier using the _Custom Public URL_ input box. This URL must be unique from any other custom URLs that you have selected for your other published documents.

A valid URL contains only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.

This is the same process as setting [custom URLs for documents](/publishing/documents.html).
