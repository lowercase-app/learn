# Search Engine Optimization

When published, portions of your document (or slides) are used to populate page `meta` to help with search engine optimization and sharing (`og` and `twitter` tags).

Other factors are also important

## Meta information

### title

The page title of the published document is set as the [document title](#document-titles).

### description

The first 160 characters of the document becomes the page description.

### keywords

Document [topics](/guide/topic-tags.html) are joined together and set in the `<meta keywords="">` tag.
