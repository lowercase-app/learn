# Code highlighting

If the code theme is enabled in your settings, then each document will use the selected code theme by default when a document is created. The theme can be changed by selected a different theme in the document's settings.

## Themes

When published, all code will be highlighted using the document-specific theme. If not selected, the selected theme in your settings will be used.

Code themes available include _Github_, _GitHub Gist_, _Nord_, _a11y dark_, _a11y light_, and _Tomorrow Night_.

## Programming Languages

Invoke a specific syntax highlight by prefixing the name with ` ``` `.

Try to always use a specific command above if applicable to the language
that you are using. There will always be a corresponding language input rule as
new languages are added.
